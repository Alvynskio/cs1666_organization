	* Manager: Caleb Kessler
	* Goals:
		1. Get project description and goals approved
1. 9/29 - 10/5

1. 10/6 - 10/19
	* Manager: Dane Halle
	* Goals:
		1. Simple movement demo encompassing "initial acceleration" to the right, standard jumping mechanics, and potentially capability for flipping.
			1.  Diagonal movement (down hill) 
			2.  API for vectors for later implementation
		2. Asset work for character and character animations, background asset(s), and ground tiling. 
		3. Advanced Topic Research
			1. Procedural gen: This team will do further research into our selected methods, being Perlin noise combined with Bezier curves. The ultimate goal will be an interface/outline for the API to be later implemented. 
			2. Physics engine: This team will do further research into rigid-body interactions as a whole as well as programming these simulations yourself. Similar interface/outline for the API to be later implemented.
