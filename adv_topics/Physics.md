# Physics advanced topic presentation outline

## Presentation 1: platformer

* Overview of what physics is in games, what is a physics engine, how physics is implemented in games typically
	* Classical mechanics/Newtonian physics: Newton’s laws for gravity, etc
	* Rigid-body dynamics: kinematics, Newton's laws of motion, collisions
	* Soft-body dynamics: fluid dynamics, Navier–Stokes equations, Particle systems
	* How we expect to implement basic physics into our game
* How we expect our portal mechanics to work
	* Projectiles
	* Overview, location moving
	* “Speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out”
	* How objects moving through portals are to be handled
	* In-depth diagrams of collision and mechanics
